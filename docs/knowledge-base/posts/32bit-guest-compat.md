# VergeOS i386 Architecture Limitation and Nested Virtualization Workaround

## Overview

The VergeOS virtualization platform supports x86_64 (64-bit) guest operating systems exclusively. Customers attempting to import or run i386 (32-bit) Windows VMs may encounter Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors during boot due to this architectural limitation.

**This guide provides a temporary workaround using nested virtualization for organizations with legacy 32-bit requirements.** However, this should be viewed as a bridge solution while planning migration to fully supported, modern infrastructure.

!!! danger "Critical: This is a Temporary Solution"
    Running 32-bit operating systems through nested virtualization is **not a viable long-term strategy**. The investment in upgrading to 64-bit operating systems and current software versions will provide better security, performance, and long-term supportability than maintaining legacy 32-bit environments.

## What You'll Learn

- How to enable nested virtualization in VergeOS for 32-bit VM compatibility
- How to configure a 64-bit hypervisor to host legacy 32-bit VMs
- Performance considerations and optimization strategies for nested environments
- How to plan your migration path away from 32-bit dependencies

## Time Estimate

**45-60 minutes** (excluding VM migration and data transfer time)

## Prerequisites

- VergeOS administrative access with cluster modification permissions
- Target 32-bit VM images or installation media
- Understanding of virtualization concepts and hypervisor selection
- Maintenance window for cluster configuration changes (for active workloads)

## Recommended Solutions

### Primary Recommendation: Upgrade to Supported Software

!!! warning "Strongly Recommended Approach"
    Before implementing the workaround below, **seriously consider upgrading to modern, supported software**:

    1. **Migrate to 64-bit Systems** - Upgrade from 32-bit Windows to 64-bit versions
    2. **Update Applications** - Replace legacy applications with 64-bit compatible versions
    3. **Evaluate Alternatives** - Research modern alternatives for outdated software
    4. **Plan Migration Timeline** - Develop a roadmap for eliminating 32-bit dependencies

### Alternative Solutions Before Nested Virtualization

Before implementing nested virtualization, try these hardware compatibility approaches:

1. **Hardware Compatibility Settings**
   - Select an older or lower version number hardware type
   - Attempt boot with SATA or IDE disk drives
   - Remove virtual optical drives from the source VM, backup, and attempt import again with only necessary disks

2. **VM Configuration Adjustments**
   - Modify CPU compatibility settings
   - Adjust memory allocation patterns
   - Test different machine types (Q35, i440fx)

### Nested Virtualization Workaround

If upgrading is not immediately feasible and hardware compatibility settings don't resolve the issue, VergeOS's **nested virtualization** feature provides a viable workaround for running 32-bit VMs.

#### How It Works

This solution involves running a 64-bit hypervisor inside VergeOS, which can then host your 32-bit VMs:

```
VergeOS Host (x86_64)
└── 64-bit VM (x86_64 compatible hypervisor)
    └── 32-bit Guest VMs (i386)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enable Nested Virtualization at Cluster Level

1. Navigate to **System > Clusters**
2. Select your target cluster
3. Click **Edit** from the left menu
4. Under **Virtualization Settings**, enable:
   - **Nested Virtualization**: Toggle to enable
   - **Allow Nested Virtualization Live Migration**: Toggle to enable (optional)
5. Click **Submit** to save changes

!!! info "Reference Documentation"
    For detailed cluster settings information, see [Cluster Settings](/product-guide/system/clusters-config-options/)

### Step 2: Create a 64-bit Host VM

Create a VM running a 64-bit hypervisor that supports 32-bit guests:

**Suggested Host Operating Systems:**
- VMware vSphere ESXi (64-bit)
- Microsoft Hyper-V Server (64-bit)
- Proxmox VE (64-bit)
- KVM-based Linux distributions (64-bit)

**VM Configuration Requirements:**
- **CPU**: Allocate sufficient cores for nested workloads
- **Memory**: Allocate enough RAM for host OS + all nested VMs
- **Storage**: Provision adequate space for all nested VM disk images
- **Machine Type**: Use Q35 for best nested virtualization support

### Step 3: Configure the Nested Hypervisor

1. Install and configure your chosen 64-bit hypervisor within the VergeOS VM
2. Import or create your 32-bit VMs within that nested environment
3. Configure networking between nested VMs and VergeOS networks as needed

## Performance Considerations

!!! warning "Performance Impact"
    Nested virtualization introduces significant overhead due to multiple virtualization layers:

    **Expected Performance Impact:**
    - **CPU**: 10-30% performance reduction depending on workload
    - **Memory**: Additional overhead for nested hypervisor
    - **Storage I/O**: Increased latency through multiple virtualization layers
    - **Network**: Minimal additional latency

**Optimization Tips:**
- Allocate dedicated CPU cores to the nested hypervisor VM
- Use VirtIO drivers where possible for best performance
- Monitor resource utilization to ensure adequate allocation
- Plan for 20-40% additional resource requirements compared to native VMs

## Migration Strategy

!!! danger "This Must Be Temporary"
    This nested virtualization approach should be considered a **temporary workaround** with a clear migration path to modern infrastructure:

    1. **Phase 1**: Implement nested virtualization for immediate compatibility
    2. **Phase 2**: Begin application assessment and modernization planning
    3. **Phase 3**: Migrate to 64-bit operating systems and current software versions
    4. **Phase 4**: Eliminate nested virtualization dependency

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

1. **Keep Systems Updated**
   - Ensure both VergeOS and nested hypervisor receive security updates
   - Maintain current patch levels for all guest operating systems

2. **Network Isolation**
   - Use appropriate network segmentation for legacy VMs
   - Implement additional security controls for unsupported operating systems

### Resource Planning

1. **Capacity Planning**
   - Account for nested virtualization overhead in resource calculations
   - Plan for 20-40% additional resource requirements compared to native VMs

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor both VergeOS host and nested hypervisor performance
   - Set up alerts for resource exhaustion

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Performance degradation**: Review resource allocation and consider hardware upgrades
- **Live migration limitations**: Ensure nested VM live migration is enabled at cluster level
- **Licensing considerations**: Verify software licensing compliance for nested environments

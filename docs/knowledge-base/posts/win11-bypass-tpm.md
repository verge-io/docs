## How to Bypass Windows 11's TPM Requirement Using the Registry Editor during the installation

---

!!! warning "**This only applies to versions of VergeOS previous to 4.11 (Atria).**"

If you have the Windows 11 install disk or ISO, you can bypass the Windows TPM and RAM requirements by making registry changes during the install.  
!!! info "This method only works on a clean install and does not allow you to bypass the requirement for at least a dual-core CPU."

1. **Boot** off of your Windows 11 install disk. [If you don't have one, one can be downloaded from here.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) The first screen should ask you to choose the language of your install (which should be correct).

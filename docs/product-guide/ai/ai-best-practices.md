## Best Practices


- trial and error
- dont overprovision memory?
- make sure model fits the task?
- protect sensitive data
- Implement robust access controls and audit trail - utilize verge granular permissions to control access
- Use pilot projects to validate infrastructure and workflows before scaling
- ongoing tracking of performance and usage

### Access Management

Control access to AI features through VergeOS's built-in security:

#### User Permissions
- **Role-Based Access**: Control who can create and manage AI components
- **Resource Limits**: Set resource allocation limits per user or group
- **Audit Trails**: Monitor AI resource usage and access

#### API Security
- **Authentication**: Secure API access to AI services
- **Authorization**: Control API endpoint access
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement usage controls and quotas

#### CPU Allocation
- **Cores**: Allocate sufficient CPU cores based on model requirements
- **Performance**: More cores enable faster inference and parallel processing
- **Scalability**: Consider future scaling when allocating resources

AI workloads require careful resource management to ensure optimal performance:

### Storage Considerations

AI models require storage for:

#### Model Files
- **Storage Tiers**: Select appropriate storage tier based on performance needs
- **Capacity**: Ensure sufficient space for model files
- **Performance**: Faster storage improves model loading times

#### Context and History
- **Chat History**: Configure conversation history retention
- **Context Size**: Set appropriate context window size for model capabilities
- **Persistence**: Determine data persistence requirements

#### Memory Allocation
- **RAM**: Ensure adequate memory for model loading and inference
- **Requirements**: Larger models require more memory
- **Efficiency**: Proper memory allocation prevents performance bottlenecks

### GPU Configuration

For enhanced AI performance, GPU resources can be allocated:

#### GPU Resource Groups
- **CPU Only**: Use CPU-only processing (default)
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize GPU hardware for faster inference
- **Hybrid**: Allow CPU fallback when GPU resources are unavailable

### Model Selection

Choose appropriate models based on your requirements:

#### Performance Considerations
- **Resource Availability**: Select models that fit your hardware constraints
- **Response Time**: Balance model capability with inference speed
- **Concurrent Users**: Consider multi-user access patterns

#### Use Case Matching
- **General Purpose**: Use Llama models for broad language tasks
- **Code Generation**: Use Phi-4 for programming and mathematical tasks
- **Specialized Tasks**: Select models optimized for specific domains

### Resource Optimization

Optimize resource allocation for efficiency:

#### Scaling Strategy
- **Start Small**: Begin with minimal resources and scale as needed
- **Monitor Usage**: Track resource utilization and adjust accordingly
- **Peak Planning**: Plan for peak usage scenarios

#### Cost Management
- **Right-Sizing**: Allocate appropriate resources without over-provisioning
- **Scheduling**: Consider workload scheduling for resource optimization
- **Monitoring**: Implement resource monitoring and alerting

### Maintenance and Updates

Keep your AI infrastructure current:

#### Model Updates
- **Version Management**: Track model versions and updates
- **Testing**: Test model updates in development environments
- **Rollback Plans**: Maintain rollback capabilities for model updates

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Response Times**: Monitor AI response performance
- **Resource Usage**: Track CPU, memory, and GPU utilization
- **Error Rates**: Monitor for AI service errors and failures

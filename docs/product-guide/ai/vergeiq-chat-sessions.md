# VergeIQ Interactive Chat Sessions

!!! info "**New Feature**"  
    This page documents functionality added in **VergeOS v26**

This page provides a guide for conducting interactive chat sessions with an AI assistant from the VergeOS UI.

!!! tip "A VergeIQ chat session requires a configured model and assistant; see the [VergeIQ Configuration Guide](/product-guide/ai/vergeiq-configuration) for setup instructions."

## Accessing a New Chat Session

* Navigate to the assistant: **AI > click to select the desired assistant**.
* Click **New Chat Session** on the left menu **-OR-** click the **'+ New'** button. 
* A Confirmation dialog is presented. 
    * (Optional) *Delete current session* can be selected to remove chat history for the present session, if there is one.
    * Select **Yes** to confirm starting a new chat session. 
* **Send prompts**, using the message entry box, to interact with the session.

## Attaching Files to a Prompt

!!! note "Attached file contents are merged into the prompt and affect total context size."

* One or more files can be attached, to provide additional context for your prompt. 
* **To attach file(s):** click the **paperclip** <i class="bi bi-paperclip"></i> **icon** to the left of the prompt entry field, **browse, and select** the desired file(s), click the **Open** button. 
* **To view/remove attached files:** The number of attached files is indicated directly to the right of the paperclip <i class="bi bi-paperclip"></i> button. You can click on this number to view/modify the list of attached files.
* **Attached files remain for each subsequent session prompt**; remove files that are no longer relevant to avoid unnecessary usage of context size.

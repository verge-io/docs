# Creating Tasks

This page includes general directions for creating a schedule-based task and an event-based task, followed by specific, common-use examples.

## Create a Schedule-based Task

1. From the main dashboard click **System** on the left menu.
2. Click **Tasks/Events** on the left menu.
3. Click **New** on the left menu.
4. In **Task Triggered by:** select ***Schedule***.
5. By default, a scheduled task is configured to run one time. Optionally, the ***Repeat Every*** setting can be configured to create a recurring task, run at a frequency based on: **day(s), hour(s), minute(s), month(s), week(s), year(s)**.
6. If a repeat interval was specified, corresponding frequency criteria should be configured. For example, if day(s) specified, select the number of days or days of the week.
7. Select a **Start Date** for the task to begin.
8. Select time **hour / minute** settings for the scheduled task to start. (These settings do not apply to tasks that run at an hour or minute repeat intervals.)
9. Specify a descriptive ***Name*** for the task.
10. **Optionally**, additional information about the task can be entered in the ***Description*** field.
11. Select the desired ***Section*** from the dropdown list; this is the category of object on which to perform the task; (e.g. user, virtual machine, tenant, etc.)
12. ***Additional Settings*** are needed for some selected types, such as SMTP. These will appear in the lower left or far right area of the screen.
13. **Most selected sections** will include a dropdown list from which a **specific object** is selected; for example: the particular user or particular virtual machine to perform the task on.
14. Select the desired **Task Type**. The tasks available in this dropdown will be **specific to the section selected**; for example: for virtual machines, available types would be operations such as: Power On, Power Off, Take Snapshot, Reset, Clone, etc. *(Note: for Section ***type=SMTP***, there is **no Task Type** field)*.
15. The **Delete Task After Running** option can be selected to automatically delete the task once completed. If the task is configured to repeat, the task would be deleted after the date/time defined in the **Ends** field.
16. Click **Submit** to create the new task.

## Create an Event-based Task

1. From the main dashboard click **System** on the left menu.
2. Click **Tasks/Events** on the left menu.
3. Click **New** on the left menu.
4. In **Task Triggered by:** select **Event**.
5. In the first dialog area, select the **Section** and **Event** that will be used to trigger the task. The ***Event*** dropdown list will vary depending on the **Section** selected. For example, for *Section="User"*, Event options will include: *Logged In* and *Logged Out*.
6. Select the specific **Object** that will trigger the task (for example, the particular user or virtual machine).
7. Specify a descriptive **Name** for the task.
8. Optionally, additional information about the task can be entered in the **Description** field.
9. In the second dialog area, select a **Section** from the dropdown list to choose the category of object on which to perform the task; for example: users, virtual machines, tenants, etc.
10. ***Additional Settings*** are required for some selections, such as SMTP. These will appear in the lower left or far right area of the screen.
11. Most selections will include a dropdown list from which a **specific object** is specified; for example: the particular user or particular virtual machine on which the task will be performed.
12. Select the desired **Task Type**. The tasks available in this dropdown will be specific to the **Section** selected; for example: for virtual machines, available types would be operations such as: Power On, Power Off, Take Snapshot, Reset, Clone, etc. *(Note: for Section **type=SMTP**, there is **no Task Type** field)*.
13. Optionally, the **Delete Task After Running** option can be selected to delete the task after it has completed once.
14. Click **Submit** to create the new task.

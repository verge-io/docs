# Recipes

Recipes empower you to streamline and expedite tenant and VM deployments. A recipe allows you to pre-build a golden image and define customizable options for rapid implementation while adhering to compliance standards, business policies, security protocols, etc. 


## Key Features

* **Out-of-the-box Samples:** The **Recipe Marketplace** is automatically available with ready-to-use recipes.  You can also copy and fine-tune these recipes to fit your specific requirements
* **Recipe Exchange:** Recipes can be shared with tenants and between VergeOS systems
* **Organization/Access control:** Effortlessly organize recipes into unlimited catalogs, each with customizable access settings tailored to your needs.
* **Expansive Options:** Questions added to a recipe allow you to collect all types of input (boolean, text, dropdown lists, IP addresses, network selections, etc.) that can be used to customize per tenant/VM instance.
* **Guest OS Customizations:** [Cloud-Init and Cloudbase-init support](/product-guide/automation/vm-recipes#advanced-usage) Open-source and/or custom scripts can use variable inputs for configuration within a VM guest operating system (set username/password, install applications, configure static IP or DHCP settings, specify hostname, etc.)

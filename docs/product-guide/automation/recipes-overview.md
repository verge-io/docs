# Recipes

Recipes empower you to streamline and expedite your tenant and VM deployments. A recipe consists of a pre-built golden image and defined customizable options that simplify new implementations while reinforcing adherence to compliance standards, or other policies and protocols.


## Key Features

* **Out-of-the-box Samples:** The [**Recipe Marketplace**](/product-guide/automation/vm-recipes#included-vm-recipes) is automatically available with ready-to-use recipes that can also be cloned and fine-tuned to fit your specific requirements.
* **Recipe Exchange:** [**Share Recipes**](/product-guide/automation/recipes-organization#sharing-recipes) with tenants and between VergeOS systems. 
* **Organization/Access control:** Effortlessly organize recipes into unlimited catalogs, each with configurable access settings.
* **Expansive Options:** Questions added to a recipe allow you to collect all types of input (boolean, text, dropdown lists, IP addresses, network selections, etc.) that can be used to tailor each tenant/VM instance.
* **Guest OS Customizations:** [**Cloud-Init and Cloudbase-init Integration**](/product-guide/automation/vm-recipes#advanced-usage) enable you to use open-source and/or custom scripts to  automate configuration within a guest operating system from variable inputs (set username/password, install applications, configure static IP or DHCP settings, specify hostname, etc.)

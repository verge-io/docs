# Schedules

VergeOS includes a **Schedule** feature as a modular component within the task manager, enabling users to fully customize when and how tasks are executed.

- Users can define **custom schedules** to automatically trigger tasks at specific dates and times.
- Schedules can be configured as **one-time** or **recurring**, supporting ongoing automation.
- A single schedule can be reused across multiple tasks. For example, to run a monthly checklist on the first day of each month, you can create one schedule and apply it to several tasks.


VergeOS includes a set of commonly-used default schedules. You can also create your own custom schedules by following these steps:

## Navigate to the Schedule Dashboard

1. Navigate to **System** > **Tasks**, then select **Schedules** from the left-hand menu.  
   The list of existing schedules will appear.

2. Click **New** in the left-hand menu to begin creating a new schedule.

3. Fill out the schedule fields:
   - **Name**: Provide a descriptive name for the schedule.
   - **Description**: Optionally add context or notes about its purpose.
   - **Recurring Schedule**:  
     Use the **Repeat Every** fields to define the frequency: choose from *days, hours, minutes, months, weeks,* or *years*.  
     Then specify any corresponding criteria, such as for **days**, select the number of days or specific weekdays, and for **months**, choose the day of the month.
   - **One-Time Schedule**:  
     To create a single-use schedule, select **Does Not Repeat** from the frequency dropdown, then specify the **Start Date** and **Time**.
   - **End Date (optional)**:  
     By default, a new schedule is configured to be perpetual. To set an end date, uncheck **Never Ends** and choose the desired end date and time.

4. Click **Submit** to save the schedule.  
   Once saved, it will be available to assign as a **schedule trigger** for any task.

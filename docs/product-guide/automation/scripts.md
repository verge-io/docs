# Scripts

The Scripts feature, introduced in VergeOS version 26, lays the foundation for future automation capabilities within the platform. While it is currently reserved for internal system operations, it has been designed with extensibility in mind. In future releases, VergeOS plans to expand this feature to support administrator-defined automation workflows. Although not available for external use yet, Scripts represent an early step toward a more flexible and programmable VergeOS experience.

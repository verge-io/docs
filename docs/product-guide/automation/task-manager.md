# Task Manager

The *Task Manager* allows initiating automatic operations based on an event or a specific date/time schedule with optional recurrence.

## Examples of Event-based Tasks

- Send an email message when a system update has completed
- Power on a particular virtual machine any time a certain user logs into VergeOS

## Examples of Schedule-based Tasks

- Initiate a check and download of system updates every Saturday at 5:00PM
- Disable a user account (perhaps for a temporary employee) at a date 30 days out
- Power off a tenant on a specific date

See [*Create Tasks*](/product-guide/automation/create-tasks) for detailed instructions on creating event and scheduled tasks.

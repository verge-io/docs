# Backup & Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)

VergeOS provides comprehensive, built-in data protection and business continuity capabilities that safeguard your critical operations from cyberattacks, ransomware, hardware failures, accidental deletions, natural disasters, and extended outages. Unlike traditional solutions that require separate backup software and complex integrations, VergeOS delivers enterprise-grade BC/DR functionality natively within the platform.

## Getting Started

New to VergeOS backup and disaster recovery? Follow this path:

1. **[Configure automated snapshots](/product-guide/backup-dr/snapshot-profiles)** - Set up regular system backups with customizable schedules
2. **[Plan your DR strategy](/product-guide/backup-dr/sync-configuration)** - Implement offsite replication to secondary sites  
3. **[Test recovery procedures](/product-guide/backup-dr/cloud-snapshot-restore)** - Validate your backup strategy with practice restores

## Core Capabilities

### Snapshots - Point-in-Time Protection

Capture comprehensive point-in-time copies of your entire infrastructure or individual components for rapid recovery with minimal data loss.

**What you can protect:**

- **Complete systems** (Cloud Snapshots) - Everything in your VergeOS environment
- **Individual virtual machines** - Specific workloads with customizable schedules
- **NAS volumes** - File-level data with granular recovery options
- **Tenant environments** - Isolated customer or departmental systems

**Recovery scenarios:**

- Roll back entire system after failed updates or security incidents
- Restore individual VMs without affecting other workloads
- Recover accidentally deleted files from NAS snapshots
- Quickly spin up development environments from production snapshots

**Key features:**

- Automated scheduling with flexible retention policies
- Space-efficient storage through deduplication
- Application-consistent snapshots with guest agent integration
- Instant snapshot creation with minimal performance impact

### Site Syncs - Offsite Replication

Replicate your VergeOS systems and data to remote locations for comprehensive backup and disaster recovery protection.

**Replication capabilities:**

- **Automated synchronization** with customizable schedules and retention
- **Bandwidth optimization** with compression and throttling controls
- **Encrypted transmission** ensuring data security in transit
- **Multi-site support** for complex replication topologies

**Common deployment scenarios:**

- **Offsite backup** - Replicate to secondary data center for data protection
- **Disaster recovery** - Maintain hot standby site for business continuity
- **Multi-location distribution** - Keep data synchronized across branch offices
- **Cloud archival** - Long-term data retention in remote VergeOS systems

**Advanced features:**

- Incremental sync technology minimizes bandwidth usage
- Automatic failover and failback capabilities
- Cross-site workload mobility
- Centralized monitoring and management

### Repair Servers (ioGuardian) - Automated Recovery

Intelligent data recovery system that automatically attempts to repair corrupted or missing data blocks by retrieving them from synchronized remote systems.

**How it works:**

- Monitors data integrity across your VergeOS infrastructure
- Automatically detects and attempts to repair data inconsistencies
- Leverages site sync destinations as repair sources
- Operates transparently without administrator intervention

**Benefits:**

- Reduces recovery time from hardware failures
- Minimizes the need for full system restores
- Maintains data availability during repair operations
- Provides additional layer of protection beyond traditional redundancy

## Integration & Monitoring

### Built-in Monitoring

- Real-time sync status and progress tracking
- Automated alerts for failed backups or sync issues
- Comprehensive reporting through subscription system
- Historical performance metrics and trends

### Third-party Integration

- Compatible with existing backup workflows
- API access for custom monitoring and automation
- Support for compliance reporting requirements
- Integration with enterprise monitoring systems

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Strategy

1. **Assess Recovery Requirements** - Define your RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
2. **Design Tiered Protection** - Combine local snapshots with remote replication
3. **Test Regularly** - Validate recovery procedures through scheduled testing
4. **Monitor Continuously** - Set up automated alerts and regular reporting

### Implementation Recommendations

- Start with cloud snapshots for comprehensive system protection
- Add VM-level snapshots for critical workloads requiring frequent backups
- Configure site syncs to geographically diverse locations
- Establish repair servers from your primary sync destinations

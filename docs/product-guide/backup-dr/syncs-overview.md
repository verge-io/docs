# Site Syncs

Site Syncs replicate complete encapsulations of your system (system snapshots) to another VergeOS system, simplifying and streamlining:   

* **Offsite Backup and Archival** - recover data in a granular level at the remote site or on the source system after syncing back 
* **Emergency Preparedness** - ensure your entire system can be ready for quick and complete recovery at a remote site to minimize downtime and ensure operational continuity  
* **Migrations** - easily move and spin up a complete system, individual tenants, or select workloads at a new location 

## Key Features
* **Complete-system, Off-site Backup** - replicates system snapshots that include your networking, VMs, tenants, NAS, and system configuration
* **Minimized Bandwidth Usage/Shorter Transfer Times** - block-level synchronization (only transferring changed data), in-flight deduplication and compression 
* **In-flight Encryption** - automatic AES 256-bit encryption 
* **Flexible Operations** - scheduling, queuing, and manual sync options 
* **Repair Server (ioGuardian)** - sync sites can be used for automatic inline healing (e.g. after multiple concurrent drive failures or power issues)

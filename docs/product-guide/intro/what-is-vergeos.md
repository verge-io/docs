# What is VergeOS

## Overview

VergeOS is a unified software-defined data center (SDDC) operating system that converges compute, storage, and networking into a single, integrated platform. Developed as an "Ultra Converged Infrastructure" (UCI), VergeOS goes beyond traditional hyperconverged infrastructure by integrating all data center functions into one unified codebase. Unlike traditional virtualization solutions that require multiple separate components and management tools, VergeOS operates as a complete infrastructure solution built from the ground up to simplify data center operations while providing enterprise-grade performance, security, and scalability.

Founded in 2010, Verge.io created the world's first vSAN technology (originally as Yottabyte) and evolved into an integrated alternative to complex multi-vendor stacks like VMware's ESXi, vSAN, and NSX combination. After shipping the current product for over six years across hundreds of production environments, VergeOS has proven its ability to reduce CAPEX/OPEX by up to 70% without compromising performance, functionality, or data resiliency.

At its core, VergeOS transforms standard commodity hardware into a powerful, distributed computing platform through innovative software that eliminates the complexity typically associated with modern data center infrastructure. Every VergeOS installation becomes a Virtual Data Center (VDC) – a portable encapsulation of compute, network, and storage resources that ensures isolation and provides autonomous management within a shared hardware environment.

## Core Architecture

### Single Operating System Approach

VergeOS fundamentally differs from traditional infrastructure solutions by providing everything as a single operating system installation. Where other platforms require you to install a hypervisor, then add separate management tools, storage solutions, and networking components, VergeOS includes all these capabilities natively through what it calls the "1 UI / 1 API / 1 Update = 1 Install Package" approach:

**Traditional Infrastructure Stack:**

- Physical Hardware
- Hypervisor (ESXi, Hyper-V, etc.)
- Management Layer (vCenter, SCVMM, etc.)
- Storage Solution (vSAN, SAN, NAS)
- Network Virtualization (NSX, etc.)
- Multiple Management Interfaces

**VergeOS Ultra Converged Infrastructure:**

- Physical Hardware
- VergeOS (Complete SDDC Operating System with unified codebase)
- Single Unified Management Interface

This architectural approach eliminates compatibility issues, reduces licensing complexity, and significantly simplifies ongoing management and maintenance. The unified codebase ensures that all components work together seamlessly, providing greater efficiency and reliability than traditional three-tier architectures.

### Built-in Hypervisor (VergeHV)

VergeHV is the integrated Type-1 hypervisor at the heart of VergeOS, built on proven KVM technology. Unlike hypervisors that operate as separate layers, VergeHV is seamlessly integrated into the VergeOS operating system, providing:

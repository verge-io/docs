# Creating an Internal Network with External Access

Giving an internal network external access requires having the proper default gateway rule in place to route through an external network.

## Automatically Create the Default Gateway Rule (during network creation)

Select an appropriate external network in the **Default Gateway** field when creating a new internal network. The gateway will automatically create the appropriate routing rules to provide LAN and/or WAN access (depending on the physical connection/settings of the external network selected) to the internal network.

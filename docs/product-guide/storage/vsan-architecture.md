## Block-Level Operations

### Data Block Management

- **Block Creation**:
    - VM disks are divided into multiple blocks
    - Each block is assigned a unique cryptographic hash
    - Block size is optimized for performance and efficiency
    - Metadata tracks block relationships and locations

### Hash-Based Distribution

- **Block Identification**:
    - Each data block receives a cryptographic hash value
    - Hash serves as a unique identifier for the block
    - Used for both location mapping and deduplication

- **Distribution Algorithm**:
    - Blocks are distributed based on hash values
    - Ensures even distribution across available nodes
    - Prevents hot spots in the storage system
    - Facilitates efficient data retrieval

## Data Distribution Architecture

### Primary Storage

- **Block Placement**:
    - Primary copy of each block stored on optimal node
    - Placement determined by hash-based algorithm
    - Considers storage tier requirements
    - Optimizes for performance and capacity

### Primary Storage

- **Access Patterns**:
    - Reads prioritize single-copy access for efficiency
    - System defaults to reading from primary copy
    - Automatically reads from redundant copy if primary is slow/unresponsive
    - Optimizes by reading from local redundant copy when on same node
    - Write operations always update both primary and redundant copies
    - Automatic redistribution as needed

### Data Access

- **Read Operations**:
    - Quick block location lookup via hash
    - Intelligent source selection:
        - Prioritizes primary copy
        - Uses local redundant copy when on same node
        - Fails over to redundant copy if primary is unresponsive
    - Optimized for minimal network traffic
    - Performance optimization through locality awareness

- **Write Operations**:
    - New block hash generation
    - Simultaneous update of primary and redundant copies
    - Guaranteed write consistency across copies
    - Metadata updates
    - Consistency maintenance

### Redundant Storage

- **Redundancy Management**:
    - Secondary copies maintained for data protection
    - Distribution across different nodes
    - Automatic synchronization of copies
    - Configurable redundancy levels

- **Failover Handling**:
    - Automatic failover to redundant copies
    - Transparent to applications and VMs
    - Immediate availability during node failures
    - Self-healing capabilities

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)

- **Node Addition**:
    - Seamless integration of new nodes
    - Requires minimum of two nodes per cluster for redundancy
    - New nodes must match existing cluster configuration:
        - Processor type
        - Memory configuration
        - Physical disk drive configuration
    - Maintains N+1 redundancy for high availability
    - Automatic data redistribution
    - Performance optimization
    - Capacity expansion

- **Cluster Expansion**:
    - Linear scalability
    - Option to create new clusters if matching nodes unavailable
    - Each new cluster requires minimum of two matching nodes
    - Resource optimization
    - Performance maintenance
    - Balanced distribution

### Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)

- **Resource Enhancement**:
    - Storage capacity increase:
        - Requires equal drive additions across all cluster nodes
        - Maintains balanced storage distribution
    - Memory expansion:
        - Requires maintenance mode before power off
        - Ensures graceful workload migration
    - Performance improvement
    - Capability expansion
    - Efficiency optimization

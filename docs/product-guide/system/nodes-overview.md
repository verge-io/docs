# Nodes Overview

A node in VergeOS represents a physical or virtual server that contributes compute, storage, and networking resources to your environment. The Nodes dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities for each node in your system.

## Key Components

### Node Status Information

- **Status**: Shows the current operational state (Running/Offline)
- **Maintenance Mode**: Indicates if the node is in maintenance state
- **IPMI Status**: Displays the status of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface
- **System Version**: Shows current VergeOS version and kernel information

### Resource Metrics

- **CPU Usage**: Real-time monitoring of processor utilization
- **Storage**: Drive status and utilization

### Node Statistics

The dashboard provides key metrics for:

- Physical RAM utilization
- Virtual RAM allocation
- Temperature
- Running Machines
- Core usage
- Machine RAM Usage

### Connected Devices

Tracks and manages:

- Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- PCI Devices
- Storage Drives
- USB Devices
- GPU Devices (if applicable)

### Running Machines

Displays active workloads including:

- Virtual Machines
- Containers
- Network Services
- Resource consumption per workload

## Key Features

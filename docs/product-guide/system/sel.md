# The System Event Log (SEL)

The System Event Log (SEL) contains events from the hardware IPMI interface. Since this log is stored on hardware there is a limited capacity; after the SEL is full, new events cannot be recorded until it is cleared. The node dashboard displays a percentage bar to indicate the amount of SEL capacity currently used on the node.

## Clear a Node's SEL

1. From the top menu, navigate to **Infrastructure** > **Nodes**.
2. **Double-click the desired Node** to access the **Node dashboard**.
3. Click **Clear SEL** on the left menu.
4. Click **Yes** to confirm.

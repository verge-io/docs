# Service Containers

The Service Containers section provides visibility into the lightweight environments used to run specific internal VergeOS services, such as AI modules and other system-level components. These containers operate independently to ensure modularity, isolation, and efficient resource usage within the virtual data center.

While this section is not typically relevant for day-to-day administration, it is available under Infrastructure > Service Containers for informational and debugging purposes. Users may occasionally reference this area to verify container status or assist with support diagnostics, but direct interaction is rarely required.

This section exists primarily to support internal operations and future extensibility. No configuration or management actions are expected from administrators at this time

**Version Compatibility**: This functionality is available in VergeOS 26.0 and later.

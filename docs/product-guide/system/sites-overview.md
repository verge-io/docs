# Sites Dashboard

The Sites Dashboard provides a central location for monitoring and administration of multiple VergeOS systems. This dashboard aggregates top-level statistics from all the systems to a single screen, with drill-down links to access and view more detailed information. A specific site page can be selected by clicking on its UI card or map coordinate pin (placement based on specified latitude/longitude values).

  The Subscriptions icon will be orange if you are subscribed to the current page (i.e. you own subscriptions that pertain to this part of the UI.)

## Access All Subscriptions

1. From the top menu, navigate to **System** > **Subscriptions**.
This will normally list all subscriptions owned by all users. From this page, **subscriptions can be selected for edit/delete** (with proper permissions), and new **subscriptions can be added.**

!!! note "By default, all users can **view all** subscriptions but **cannot modify subscriptions other than their own**. **Administrators can adjust user permissions** to suit their organization."

!!! tip "Throughout the VergeOS UI, the *Sort* and *Filter* Options at the top of columns can be helpful for working with longer lists."

# Users and Groups

## Users

A separate user account should be created for each individual that will utilize the system. 

!!! success "Authorization Source"
    When using an Authorization Source, there is an option to auto-create users from the source.

### User Types:

- **Normal** - intended for full UI access
- **API** - intended for service accounts only; e.g. running scripts, syncs, etc.
- **VDI** - VDI user dashboard only

## Groups

A group is a collection of users. Groups can also contain other groups. Administration of permissions and subscriptions can often be simplified by the use of groups.

## To Create a New User:

1. From the Main Dashboard, select **System**.
2. Select **Users**.
3. Select **New**.
4. Select an ***Authorization Source*** if appropriate (This field will not display if no third-party authorization sources are configured for the system). The default selection of "--None--" creates a user that authenticates directly via VergeOS.

!!! note
    If the authorization source has been configured to auto create users, do not create the user here.

5. Enter a ***Username***; this will be the user's login name. The username must be unique within this cloud (Note: each tenant is a separate VergeOS Cloud).
6. Select appropriate user ***Type***:
    - **Normal** - users that will log in to the full UI
    - **API** - used for service accounts, such as those used for site syncs
    - **VDI** - user that will log in only to a VDI dashboard
7. Enter a ***Password*** for the user. Passwords must conform to password complexity settings defined for this VergeOS cloud; requirements are listed underneath the field. Complexity settings are defined in System -> Settings -> Password Complexity Requirement.
8. Re-enter the password in the ***Confirm Password*** field.
9. Optionally, the ***Require Password Change*** option can be enabled to prompt the user to create their own password upon first login.
10. Optionally, a ***Display Name*** can be specified for the user. The Display Name is shown in the top right corner of the screen when the user is logged into the UI.
11. When enabled, ***Two Factor Authentication*** requires use of a security code (received via user email) in addition to username/password for login to the VergeOS system.
12. ***Email Address*** is used when sending subscription reports and alerts assigned to the user and for Two-Factor Authentication, if applicable.
13. The ***Physical Access*** option can be checked to allow the user direct console access to nodes. 

!!! warning
    **CAUTION:** Enabling the *Physical Access* option allows the account to log in at the command-line via physical access (e.g. crashcart, ipmi remote control) and SSH. **This should only be granted to users entrusted with low-level VergeOS server administration.**

- **SSH Keys** can be added to provide key-based authentication for SSH; multiple keys can be defined to allow the user to authenticate by ssh key from various computers. Note: SSH Keys are optional; a user granted physical access can log into an SSH session with username/password in the absence of an associated SSH key.

    **To Add a new SSH Key entry:**
  - An initial blank line will appear where an SSH key can be typed in.
  - Additional keys can be added, as needed, by clicking the plus [ ] button which will insert a new blank line where an SSH key can be typed in.

    **To Select and Deselect Key(s) for Move/Edit/Delete:**
  - Selected entries will display a check in the box at the left.
  - Selection is a toggle: click an unselected entry to select it; click a selected entry to deselect it.
  - Multiple keys can be selected for a delete or move.

    **To Edit an Existing Key entry:**
  - Click to select the desired key for edit.
  - Click the edit [ ] button.
  - The selected key appears and can be modified. When editing is complete, click the edit [ ] button again to save the changes.

    **To Delete an Existing Key entry:**
  - Click to select the desired key for deletion.
  - Click the delete [ ] button.

14. Optionally, under ***Member of Groups***, groups can be selected in which to add the user. Hint: Multiple groups can be selected by holding down the Shift or Ctrl key.
15. Click **Submit** to save the new user.

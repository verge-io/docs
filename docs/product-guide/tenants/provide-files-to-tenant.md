# Providing Files to a Tenant

A service provider can provide files, that are uploaded to the vSAN, to a tenant. For help in the initial upload of files to the parent vSAN, see: [**Media Images**](/product-guide/storage/uploading-files-to-vsan)

## Provide a File to a Tenant

1. From the Main Dashboard, Click **Tenants** on the left menu.
2. Click **Tenants** to view a listing of all tenants on this system.
3. **Double-click** on the desired **tenant**.
4. Click **Add File** on the left menu.
5. Select ***File Type*** from the dropdown list (HINT: you can select --ALL-- to get a listing of all files available, regardless of type; this will include \*.raw files(VM disk images) from the parent VDC.)
6. **Select a file** from the dropdown list.
7. Click **Submit** (bottom of page).

The process is near-instant as it is done with a branch command. The file is now available to the tenant within their own [**Media Images**](/product-guide/storage/uploading-files-to-vsan) section.

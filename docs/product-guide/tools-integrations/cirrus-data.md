# Cirrus Data Integration with VergeOS

## Overview

The Cirrus Data integration with VergeOS provides advanced data mobility solutions that eliminate complexity and accelerate migration processes for virtualized environments. This integration enables seamless data movement between storage systems, cloud platforms, and hypervisors while maintaining business continuity and minimizing operational disruption.

## Key Features

- Non-disruptive workload migration between hypervisor and public cloud platforms
- Zero footprint deployment with no physical or virtual appliances required
- Single-line installation command that can be automated at scale
- Zero-downtime end-to-end migration including final I/O cutover
- Intelligent Quality of Service (iQoS) that dynamically manages bandwidth impact
- Automated storage integration with plug-ins for major storage platforms
- Encryption and data reduction delivering up to 8x bandwidth savings
- Cloud-based portal for centralized management of thousands of migration sessions

## Integration Benefits

- **Zero Downtime Migrations**: Move data and workloads without service interruption
- **Cloud Migration**: Move workloads from public cloud to on-premises VergeOS deployments
- **Virtualization Platform Migration**: Migrate from other hypervisors like VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V and Nutanix to VergeOS

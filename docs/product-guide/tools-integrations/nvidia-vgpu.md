# NVIDIA vGPU Integration with VergeOS

## Overview

The NVIDIA integration with VergeOS enables GPU acceleration for virtual machines through NVIDIA's GRID vGPU technology. This integration allows multiple VMs to share physical GPU resources while maintaining performance isolation, making it ideal for AI/ML workloads, virtual desktop infrastructure, content creation, and high-performance computing applications.

## Key Features

- **Shared GPU Resources**: Multiple VMs can access a single physical GPU with guaranteed isolation and performance
- **Flexible vGPU Profiles**: Choose from workload-optimized configurations across NVIDIA's line of vGPU supported products
- **Live Migration Support**: Move GPU-accelerated VMs between nodes without downtime
- **Enterprise Management**: Centralized GPU resource allocation and monitoring through VergeOS interface
- **Hardware Virtualization**: Support for all NVIDIA GPUs with vGPU capability

## Integration Benefits

- **Cost Optimization**: Maximize GPU hardware utilization across multiple workloads instead of dedicated GPU per VM
- **Simplified Management**: GPU resources managed through familiar VergeOS resource groups and policies
- **Enhanced Security**: Hardware-level isolation between GPU workloads with tenant separation
- **Operational Efficiency**: Unified platform for both traditional and GPU-accelerated virtual machines
- **Scalable Performance**: Dynamic resource allocation based on workload demands and priorities

## Supported Use Cases

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:**

- Deep learning model training and inference with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and RAPIDS
- GPU-accelerated data science workflows and Jupyter notebook environments
- Large-scale analytics and real-time inference deployment

**Virtual Desktop Infrastructure:**

- Research applications in genomics, astronomy, and materials science

## Architecture

The NVIDIA integration consists of three main layers:

**Physical Layer:**

- NVIDIA GPU hardware
- NVIDIA GRID host drivers installed on VergeOS nodes
- IOMMU/SR-IOV hardware virtualization support

**Virtualization Layer:**

- VergeOS resource groups for GPU device management
- Configurable vGPU profiles for different workload types
- Policy-based resource allocation and scheduling

**Application Layer:**

- NVIDIA guest drivers installed in virtual machines
- CUDA runtime and development libraries in virtual machines
- Integration with AI frameworks and professional applications in virtual machines

## Supported Hardware

!!! info "Hardware Requirements"
    - NVIDIA vGPU functionality requires a valid **NVIDIA vGPU software license**, such as Virtual PC, Virtual Apps, or Virtual Workstation. These licenses must match the selected vGPU profile and workload type.
    - Only select data center and professional GPUs support vGPU. Verify hardware and driver compatibility in the [NVIDIA vGPU Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-release-notes-generic-linux-kvm/index.html#supported-gpus){target="_blank"}.
    - For an overview of licensing options, refer to the [NVIDIA Licensing Guide](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/virtual-solutions/){target="_blank"}.

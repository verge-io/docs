# NVIDIA vGPU Integration with VergeOS

## Overview

The NVIDIA integration with VergeOS enables GPU acceleration for virtual machines through NVIDIA's GRID vGPU technology. This integration allows multiple VMs to share physical GPU resources while maintaining performance isolation, making it ideal for AI/ML workloads, virtual desktop infrastructure, content creation, and high-performance computing applications.

## Key Features

- **Shared GPU Resources**: Multiple VMs can access a single physical GPU with guaranteed isolation and performance
- **Flexible vGPU Profiles**: Choose from workload-optimized configurations (A-series for VDI, B-series for AI/ML, Q-series for professional graphics)
- **Live Migration Support**: Move GPU-accelerated VMs between nodes without downtime (experimental in 4.13+)
- **Enterprise Management**: Centralized GPU resource allocation and monitoring through VergeOS interface
- **Hardware Virtualization**: Support for Tesla, Quadro, and RTX series GPUs with vGPU capability

## Integration Benefits

- **Cost Optimization**: Maximize GPU hardware utilization across multiple workloads instead of dedicated GPU per VM
- **Simplified Management**: GPU resources managed through familiar VergeOS resource groups and policies
- **Enhanced Security**: Hardware-level isolation between GPU workloads with tenant separation
- **Operational Efficiency**: Unified platform for both traditional and GPU-accelerated virtual machines
- **Scalable Performance**: Dynamic resource allocation based on workload demands and priorities

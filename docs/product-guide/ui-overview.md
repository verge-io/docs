# Getting Started with the VergeOS UI (Version 25.2)

The following guide provides an overview of the 25.2 VergeOS User Interface (UI), covering the most basic, essential UI concepts to help you get oriented quickly.


!!! tip Upgrading from 4.13
    If you are already familiar with a previous version of VergeOS, [Transitioning from version 4.13 to 25.2](/product-guide/ui-update252) can give you the basics for shifting to the updated user interface.

While VergeOS 25.2 introduces a refreshed look and several usability enhancements, the core structure remains comfortably familiar. The interface still follows the **overview-to-detail dashboard model**, with a **menu-driven navigation system** that echoes the layout of version 4.13. Users will find the same general flow, with minor organizational updates that improve clarity and accessibility.

Key improvements include:
- Enhanced visual cues to help you **understand where you are** in the interface and **see all available options** at a glance.
- A **modernized look and feel**, offering a more polished and intuitive experience.
- Continued focus on delivering a **robust, convenient interface** that supports both new and experienced users.

## What’s New in 25.2

While the UI retains much of its familiar structure, a few notable changes enhance usability:

- **Persistent top navigation bar**: The main menu now remains visible at all times, making it easier to switch contexts without losing your place.
- **Status indicators redesigned**: Tiles and cards now display **status bars** instead of circular indicators, offering clearer visual feedback.
- **Minor menu reorganization**: Some navigation elements have been regrouped for better logical flow.
- **Breadcrumb behavior**: Breadcrumbs may behave slightly differently — we’ll highlight any changes in the detailed navigation section.

- Main system logs
- Left Navigation menu to access subsections of the application
- Quick links within the Dashboard section to drill down to subsections

From there, you can click on different general areas of the system, such as networking, virtual machines, Users to see information more specific to those sections.  Within those sections, you can select specific instances - such as a particular network, or an individual VM, to investigate the particular object. 

### Dashboard Examples

Dashboards, providing at-a-glance information (and quick-link access to more detailed information), are available throughout the system. Subsections, such as networks, machines, and storage each have one. Specific instances of objects also have their own dashboard as well, such as each individual: VM, network, node, tenant, etc. Every dashboard contains many links that can be used to dive further into more detailed information.

#### Example 1: Networks Dashboard

The Networks Dashboard provides overall network statistics, network-related logs, and links to drill down into more detailed information per network, network device, etc.

# Virtual Machine Management (VergeHV)

VergeHV is the integrated hypervisor at the heart of VergeOS, providing enterprise-grade virtual machine management through a unified platform that converges compute, storage, and networking. Built on proven KVM technology and designed as a Type-1 hypervisor, VergeHV delivers near bare-metal performance while simplifying infrastructure management through a single, comprehensive interface.

## Why Choose VergeHV?

Whether you're consolidating physical servers, migrating from legacy hypervisors, or building a new virtual infrastructure, VergeHV provides the foundation for modern, scalable virtualization. Unlike traditional solutions that require separate management tools for compute, storage, and networking, VergeHV integrates all these components into a cohesive platform that reduces complexity and operational overhead.

## Prerequisites

Before creating your first virtual machines, ensure your VergeOS environment meets these requirements:

- **System Setup**: VergeOS installed with at least two nodes for high availability
- **Storage Configuration**: vSAN storage tiers properly configured and available
- **Network Configuration**: External and internal networks configured for VM connectivity
- **Media Files**: Installation ISOs uploaded to vSAN for guest operating system installation
- **Resource Planning**: Adequate CPU, memory, and storage resources allocated for planned workloads

For detailed system requirements, see the [VergeOS Installation Guide](/implementation-guide/installation-guide).

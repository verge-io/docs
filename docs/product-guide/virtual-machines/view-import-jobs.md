!!! info "A UUID (rather than the VM name) displayed in the VM field indicates that a VM with that unique identifier already existed in the VergeOS system (e.g. previously imported). If a UUID is displayed, the VM was imported as a [snapshot](/product-guide/backup-dr/snapshots-overview) to avoid inadvertently overwriting an existing VergeOS VM."

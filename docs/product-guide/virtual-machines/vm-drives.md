# Virtual Machine Drives

## Add a Drive to a VM

1. From the **VM dashboard**, click **New Drive** on the left menu (near the bottom).
2. Enter a ***Name*** for the drive (optional).
!!! success
    When *Name* is not specified, the system automatically names drives in order as created, "drive\_x" where x is an integer starting with 0. For drives that will be used as a "Golden Image", it is recommended to give a name to the drive for easy selection when creating non-persistent drives based on the drive.

3. The ***Read Only*** option can be useful for a drive that should not be modified, such as on a VM restore that is used to recover data.
4. Select ***Media*** (type) for the drive:
    - **Disk (default option)** - empty disk; emulates typical SSD/HDD device
    - **CD-ROM** - emulates CD-ROM device; read-only; associated \*.iso file simulates inserted CD media; typically used for installing OS or other software.
    - **Clone Disk** - create a duplicate of an existing disk from the same VergeOS cloud.
    - **EFI Disk** - this drive type is auto-generated and handled by the system; there should never be a need to manually create a drive of this type.
    - **Import Disk** - allows selection of a standard format disk file (\*.raw,\*.vmdk,\*.qcow, \*.vhd(x), etc).
    - **Non-Persistent** - allows for a drive that does not maintain changes between boots; each time the VM is started, the non-persistent drive reverts back to the \*.raw file image (an existing disk drive in the VergeOS cloud) to which it is referenced. A typical use for the Non-Persistent drive would be maintaining a "golden image" OS install where all updates and modifications can be made centrally; this is particularly useful for solutions, such as VDI, where a consistent installation needs to be maintained for many virtual machines.

5. Select ***Interface***:
    - **Virtio-SCSI** - (typically recommended option). provides para-virtualized SCSI device; with high performance, while still maintaining standard command set, device passthrough, and device naming within guest OS. There is built-in support in most Linux distros, but not standard in default Windows installations, however, Virtio drivers are available at: [https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso) ; virtio drivers are also included within VergeOS custom Windows \*.iso files.
    - **Virtio(Legacy)** - this driver was previously scheduled to be phased out; however, development has commenced again. It can be used for utmost I/O performance with the tradeoff being that some native SCSI features, such as TRIM are not supported.
    - **Virtio-SCSI (Dedicated Controller)** - provides a para-virtualized SCSI device with its own controller. Use this option if adding a virtio-SCSI drive to reside on a different storage tier than existing virtio-SCSI drives within the same VM. For example, if tier 3 virtio-SCSI drive(s) have already been created for the VM, create a tier 2 Virtio-SCSI drive as Dedicated Controller to keep the different tiered drives on separate virtual controllers.
    - **LSI***** - LSI, native VMware options provided for compatibility, where needed.
    - **SATA(AHCI)** - option only applies to VMs with a Q35 Machine Type.
    - **IDE** - option only applies to VMs with a PC (i440FX) Machine Type.
6. Select ***Disk Size***. This option only applies to Media type: **Disk**.
7. Select ***Media File***. This option only applies to Media Type: **CD-ROM/Clone Disk/Import Disk/ Non-Persistent**.
    - For **CD-ROM:** Select *.iso file from the dropdown list. Note: \*.iso file can also be selected after VM creation.
    - For **Clone Disk:** Select *.raw file from the dropdown list
    - For **Import Disk:** Select disk image file* from the dropdown list. Supported file types: (*.raw,*.qcow,*.qcow2,*.vhd, *.vhdx,*.vmdk)
    - For **Non-Persistent Disk:** Select *.raw file from the dropdown list displaying all existing VergeOS drives in this cloud.
!!! success
    See [**Media Images**](/product-guide/vsan/uploading-files-to-vsan) for instructions on uploading iso and disk image files to the vSAN

8. Select ***Preferred Tier***. This option only applies to Media types: **Disk/EFI Disk**.
    - Options include all storage tiers to which you have access.
    - **--Default--** can also be selected to use the default storage tier defined for this cloud in system settings.
9. Select the ***Override Preferred Tier*** checkbox: (only applies to Media type: **Clone Disk/Import Disk /Non-Persistent**), if a different Tier is desired (different from the current tier of the selected Media File.) This option only applies to Media Type: **CD-ROM/Clone Disk/Import Disk/ Non-Persistent**.
!!! success
    For more information about vSAN Storage tiers, see [**Storage Tiers**](/product-guide/vsan/storage-tiers)

10. Enter a ***Description*** for the drive (optional, but recommended when there will be more than one drive)
11. The ***Asset*** field can be used to define a unique identifier for this drive (e.g. OS, Data drive, etc.) for a drive that can be used within Recipes.
!!! info
    The Discard option is enabled by default, and is typically recommended to be enabled as it allows storage space to be recovered from deleted files.

12. Click **Submit.**
13. **Repeat** the process to add more drives to the VM, **as needed**.

## Erase the Data on a Drive

!!! warning
    **Caution** should be used when erasing a drive since erasing a crucial drive can render the VM unusable. Take special care to ensure an erase operation is being applied to the intended drive on the intended VM. A temporary VM snapshot can be taken prior to erasing the drive, to allow a fallback if needed.

The **VM must be powered off** before a drive can be erased.

1. From the **VM dashboard**, click **Drives** from the left menu.  
2. **Select the drive(s)** to be erased.
3. Click **Erase** from the left menu.
4. Click **Yes** to confirm.

## Remove a Drive from a VM

A **drive must be offline before it can be deleted**; a drive can be taken offline by powering off the VM or using hotplug (where enabled).

1. From the **VM dashboard**, click **Drives** from the left menu.  
2. **Select the drive(s)** to be deleted.
3. Click **Delete** from the left menu.
4. Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.

## Modify a VM Drive

!!! info "Considerations"
    - Once a drive is created, the *Media* field (Disk/Non-Persistent/CD-ROM) cannot be modified.
    - Drives cannot be reduced in size.
    - Modifications involving drive size or drive interface type will likely require corresponding modifications within the guest OS; specific guest OS changes will be dependent on the particular OS in use.

1. From the **VM dashboard**, click **Drives** from the left menu.
2. **Select the drive** to be modified.
3. Click **Edit** from the left menu.
4. **Modify** fields as desired.
5. Click **Submit**.

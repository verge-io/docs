### Native VergeOS Import Methods

#### [**VergeOS VMware Connector**](/product-guide/virtual-machines/import-from-vmware) 

**Recommended for:** Small to large VMware production environments

A full backup of source virtual machines into VergeOS is performed using the VMware connector. Incremental backups are then performed to capture only the changes, leveraging VMware's Change Block Tracking (CBT) for efficient transfer. Once the incremental backup duration stabilizes, indicating minimal ongoing data churn, the system is considered ready for cutover with minimal downtime.

**Key Features:**

- Live migration from running VMware environments
- Incremental backup support leveraging VMware CBT
- Batch import capabilities for multiple VMs
- Hardware-independent data access
- Minimal cutover downtime

**Storage Optimization Note:**
VMs imported from thick-provisioned VMDKs will benefit from immediate TRIM operations post-import to reclaim unused space.

2. **Network Configuration**
   - Verify network connectivity and IP assignments
   - Update DNS and DHCP reservations as needed
   - Test inter-VM communication

3. **Storage Optimization and TRIM Configuration**
   - Enable Discard on all virtual drives if not already enabled
   - Run initial TRIM operation to reclaim unused space from thick-provisioned sources
   - Configure automatic TRIM scheduling in guest OS
   - Monitor vSAN space reclamation in VergeOS dashboard
   - Consider migrating disks to appropriate storage tiers based on performance needs

4. **Security and Monitoring**
   - Enable QEMU Guest Agent for enhanced monitoring
   - Configure backup policies using VergeOS snapshots
   - Update guest OS and applications to latest versions

### Storage Optimization After Import

#### TRIM/Discard Configuration for Imported VMs

After importing VMs from other hypervisors, storage efficiency may be impacted if the source VMs were thick-provisioned. The free space inside the VM may not match what VergeOS reports due to unused blocks not being properly marked. To optimize storage utilization:

1. **Enable Discard on Virtual Drives**
   - Navigate to the imported VM's dashboard
   - Go to **Drives** and edit each virtual drive
   - Ensure **Discard** is enabled (default setting)
   - Verify drives are using **virtIO-SCSI** or **SATA** interface
   - Confirm drives are assigned to a **Solid State Tier** (typically tiers 1-3)

2. **Perform Initial TRIM Operation**
   
   **For Windows VMs:**
   ```powershell
   # Run as Administrator in PowerShell
   Optimize-Volume -DriveLetter C -ReTrim -Verbose
   
   # For additional drives
   Optimize-Volume -DriveLetter D -ReTrim -Verbose
   
   # Check if TRIM is enabled
   fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify
   
   # Enable TRIM if needed (if value shows 1)
   fsutil behavior set disabledeletenotify 0
   ```
   
   **For Linux VMs:**
   ```bash
   # Run as root or with sudo
   sudo fstrim -av
   
   # Check TRIM timer status
   sudo systemctl status fstrim.timer
   
   # Check TRIM service status
   sudo systemctl status fstrim
   ```

3. **Configure Automatic TRIM**
   - **Windows**: TRIM typically runs automatically via Storage Optimizer
   - **Linux**: Enable automatic TRIM with:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
     ```

!!! info "Storage Reclamation Benefits"
    Enabling TRIM/Discard ensures that deleted files immediately free up vSAN storage, maintaining accurate space reporting and optimal performance. This is especially important for VMs imported from thick-provisioned sources. As TRIM operations progress, you can watch the reported free space in the VergeOS dashboard increase as unused data is reclaimed.

!!! warning "Storage Space Discrepancies After Import"
    If the free space shown in VergeOS doesn't match what's available inside the VM after import:
    - This typically occurs with thick-provisioned source VMs
    - Ensure Discard is enabled on the virtual drives
    - Perform a manual TRIM operation from within the guest OS
    - Allow time for vSAN to process and reclaim the freed space
    - Monitor the VergeOS dashboard to verify space reclamation

## Best Practices and Tips

### Performance Optimization

- **Use VirtIO interfaces** whenever possible for best performance
- **Start with SATA/IDE interfaces** if experiencing boot issues, then migrate to VirtIO after driver installation

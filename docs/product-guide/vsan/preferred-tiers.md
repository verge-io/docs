# Preferred Tier

The Preferred Tier setting will establish a "first choice" for the storage tier to be used. If that tier is unavailable or there is inadequate space on the tier, the system will automatically move to the next less expensive (higher-numbered) tier, and next less expensive tier if that one is unavailable. If the Preferred Tier is unavailable and there is also no less expensive tier available, the system will move to the next more expensive(lower-numbered) tier.

## The following diagram shows an example, in which Tier 4 has been specified as the Preferred Tier

## Architecture Components

Duration: 10:00

Let's break down the key components of our VergeOS FC SAN architecture:

1. **VergeOS Nodes**: These are the servers running VergeOS. In our reference architecture, we recommend a minimum of 4 nodes for redundancy and performance.

2. **Local Flash Storage (Tier 0)**: High-performance SSDs or NVMe drives in each node, used for metadata and caching. This ensures low-latency access for critical data.

3. **Fiber Channel SAN (Tier 3)**: External storage array connected via Fiber Channel, providing high-capacity storage for less performance-sensitive data.

4. **LUNs (Logical Unit Numbers)**: These are the individual storage volumes presented by the FC SAN to the VergeOS nodes.

5. **Fiber Channel Switches**: These provide the connectivity between the VergeOS nodes and the FC SAN.

This tiered approach allows us to balance performance and capacity, ensuring that critical data is always quickly accessible while still providing ample storage for large datasets.

## Designing Your Architecture

Duration: 15:00

When designing your VergeOS FC SAN architecture, consider the following factors:

1. **Performance Requirements**: Determine the IOPS and throughput needs of your workloads. This will influence the amount of local flash storage and the performance characteristics of your FC SAN.

2. **Capacity Planning**: Estimate your current and future storage needs. This will help size your FC SAN appropriately.

3. **Redundancy**: Plan for node and storage failures. We recommend a minimum of 4 nodes for high availability.

4. **Scalability**: Consider future growth. VergeOS allows easy addition of nodes and storage capacity.

5. **Network Design**: Ensure your Fiber Channel network is properly designed for performance and redundancy.

Here's a sample configuration for a mid-sized deployment:

- 4 VergeOS Nodes:
  - 2x Intel Xeon Gold CPUs
  - 512GB RAM
  - 2x 1.6TB NVMe SSDs for Tier 0 (local flash)
- FC SAN:
  - 16 LUNs, each 2TB in size
  - Total usable capacity: 32TB

This configuration provides a good balance of performance and capacity for many workloads.

## Configuration Steps

Duration: 20:00

Now, let's walk through the high-level steps to configure this architecture:

1. **Install VergeOS**: 
   Deploy VergeOS on your nodes following the standard installation procedure.

2. **Configure Local Flash**:
   Set up the local NVMe or SSD drives as Tier 0 storage in VergeOS.

   ```
   verge-cli storage add-tier --node=node1 --tier=0 --device=/dev/nvme0n1
   verge-cli storage add-tier --node=node2 --tier=0 --device=/dev/nvme0n1
   ```

3. **Configure FC HBAs**:
   Ensure your Fiber Channel Host Bus Adapters are properly configured and recognized by VergeOS.

4. **Zone FC Switches**:
   Set up proper zoning on your FC switches to allow communication between the VergeOS nodes and the FC SAN.

5. **Present LUNs**:
   Configure your FC SAN to present the LUNs to the VergeOS nodes.

6. **Add FC LUNs to VergeOS**:
   Add the FC LUNs as Tier 3 storage in VergeOS.

   ```
   verge-cli storage add-tier --tier=3 --device=/dev/sdb
   verge-cli storage add-tier --tier=3 --device=/dev/sdc
   ```

   Repeat for all LUNs.

7. **Create Storage Policies**:
   Set up storage policies in VergeOS to determine how data is placed across the tiers.

   ```
   verge-cli policy create --name=default --tier0=20 --tier3=80
   ```

8. **Verify Configuration**:
   Check that all storage is properly recognized and configured.

   ```
   verge-cli storage list
   verge-cli policy list
   ```

Remember to adjust these commands based on your specific environment and VergeOS version.

## Best Practices

Duration: 10:00

To ensure optimal performance and reliability of your VergeOS FC SAN deployment, consider these best practices:

1. **Use Multipathing**: Configure multiple paths between VergeOS nodes and FC SAN for redundancy and load balancing.

2. **Optimize LUN Sizes**: Use consistent LUN sizes for easier management and better performance.

3. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check the performance of both local flash and FC SAN storage to identify bottlenecks.

4. **Balance Workloads**: Distribute I/O intensive workloads across nodes to prevent overloading a single node.

5. **Regular Maintenance**: Keep VergeOS, FC HBA firmware, and SAN firmware up to date.

6. **Backup Strategy**: Implement a robust backup strategy, leveraging VergeOS's snapshot capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

Duration: 5:00

If you encounter issues with your VergeOS FC SAN deployment, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure all FC connections are active and properly zoned.

2. **Verify LUN Visibility**: Confirm that all LUNs are visible to VergeOS.

3. **Monitor I/O Metrics**: Use VergeOS's built-in monitoring tools to identify performance issues.

4. **Check Logs**: Review VergeOS logs for any error messages or warnings.

5. **Engage Support**: If issues persist, don't hesitate to contact VergeOS support for assistance.

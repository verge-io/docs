## Architecture Decision Framework

VergeOS supports three primary architectural approaches, each optimized for different deployment scenarios and organizational requirements.

### Decision Matrix

| **Deployment Size** | **Recommended Architecture** | **Key Benefits** | **Typical Use Cases** |
|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **2-6 Nodes** | HCI (Hyperconverged) | Simplicity, balanced scaling | Branch offices, small data centers, edge deployments |
| **6-10 Nodes** | Hybrid UCI | Flexible growth, independent compute scaling | Growing organizations, mixed workloads |
| **10+ Nodes** | Full UCI (Ultra Converged) | Maximum performance, complete specialization | Enterprise data centers, service providers |

### Architecture Characteristics Comparison

| **Aspect** | **HCI** | **Hybrid UCI** | **Full UCI** |
|------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Node Types** | Uniform compute+storage | Controller/storage + compute | Dedicated controller, storage, compute |
| **Scaling Model** | Proportional compute and storage | Semi-independent scaling | Independent resource scaling |
| **Performance** | Balanced across all functions | Good for most workloads | Optimized for specific functions |
| **Complexity** | Low - simple to design and manage | Medium - moderate configuration | High - requires expertise and tuning |
| **Resource Efficiency** | May have underutilized resources | Better resource utilization | Maximum efficiency through specialization |

## Core Architectural Concepts

### Node Specialization

VergeOS nodes can be configured for specific functions to optimize resource utilization and performance:

**Controller Nodes (Node 1 & 2):**

- Always include Tier 0 storage for vSAN metadata
- Handle cluster management and API operations
- Optimized for memory-intensive operations
- Require high-performance storage access

**Storage-Only Nodes:**

- Maximize storage capacity and I/O performance
- No compute workloads to avoid resource contention
- Optimized for storage throughput and capacity
- Can be configured with different storage tier combinations

**Compute-Only Nodes:**

- Dedicated to running virtual machines and applications
- No storage overhead - maximum compute resources available
- Can be optimized for specific workload types (GPU, high-memory, CPU-intensive)
- Simplified hardware specifications focused on compute performance

### vSAN Storage Architecture

VergeOS vSAN distributes data blocks across all storage nodes (and disks within those nodes) using a hash-based algorithm.

**Key vSAN Principles:**

- **Block-Level Distribution:** Data blocks are evenly distributed across all available storage devices
- **N+1 Redundancy:** Always maintains one additional copy of data for fault tolerance  
- **Even Distribution:** Optimal performance requires consistent hardware across storage nodes

**Tier 0 Special Requirements:**

- Must exist on Node 1 and Node 2 (controller nodes) only
- Handles all vSAN metadata operations
- Requires high-endurance NVMe storage
- Critical for overall system performance

## Scaling Considerations

### Performance Bottlenecks

As VergeOS clusters grow, several factors become important for maintaining optimal performance:

**Network Considerations:**

- Compute-to-storage node ratios (typically 3-5:1 for optimal network utilization)
- Core network bandwidth requirements scale with node count
- Network segmentation becomes important for large deployments

**Storage Buffer Allocation:**

- Default storage buffer allocation (typically 2GB per node) is insufficient for large deployments
- Large deployments benefit from a larger storage buffer allocation on controller nodes
- Memory allocation should be optimized based on total storage capacity (and the subsequent metadata storage requirements)

**Compute Resource Management:**

- In HCI configurations, avoid running workloads on controller nodes (Node1 primarily during normal operations) to prevent resource contention
- Large deployments benefit from dedicated compute nodes to eliminate controller/compute conflicts

## Version Numbering and Updates

VergeOS uses semantic versioning with two different formats:

- **Legacy Format**: Major.Minor.Patch.Hotfix (e.g., 4.13.4.2)
- **New Format** (26.0+): YearQuarter.Minor.Patch (e.g., 26.0.1)
    - First two digits represent the year (25 = 2025, 26 = 2026)
    - Third digit represents the quarter development started (0-3)
    - Remaining digits represent minor and patch versions

!!! tip "Update Process"
    - **Minor**, **Patch**, and **Hotfix** updates support live system updates with no impact to running workloads
    - **Major** version updates *may* require a system reboot to complete the update process
    - Updates should always be performed sequentially within a major version (e.g., 4.13.2 → 4.13.3 → 4.13.4)
    - When upgrading from 4.13.x to 26.0.x, follow the upgrade path through 4.13.4.2 first

!!! note "Version Archive"
    Release notes for versions prior to 4.9 have been archived and are not available in this documentation
